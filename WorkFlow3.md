#Solution for animating human body parts

# Introduction #

After talking with Daniel we decided to animate human body parts, by connecting different parts by lines and then those lines connecting through the spring model to the joints.
Basic idea is to cut human 3d model into different parts and render them not close one to each other but with a distance, connecting them with a lines (or polygons). Then by connecting those lines to the springs, we could hopefully make a realistic human body part deformation (started working on the knee).
